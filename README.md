# IntersectionExplorer for the IUI 2016 proceedings

## About

This web application, created using Node.js and Express framework, allows visual exploration of the IUI 2016 proceedings. The visualization, applying the design of [UpSet](https://upset.app/), recommends papers from multiple aspects, including recommender agends, similar users' bookmarks, and tags. Data are retrieved from [Conference Navigator](http://halley.exp.sis.pitt.edu/cn3/portalindex.php) 

D3.js was used to create the interactive visualization.
