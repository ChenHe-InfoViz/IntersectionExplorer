# IntersectionExplorer

## About

IntersectionExplorer is an interactive visualization that allows you to explore papers of the IUI 2016 conference. The visualization shows you papers that you have bookmarked in Conference Navigator and users who are similar to you because they bookmarked similar papers. In addition, this visualization enables you to explore recommendations that are generated based on your interests.
